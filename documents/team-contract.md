# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

Ashley Ticzon (amt258)
Irena Gao (ijg24)

2. To what goals do we all commit?

  * Create the best website that we possibly can for our client.
  * Divide work equally and fairly to minimize stress.
  * Work diligently and on schedule with milestones.
  * Try to work ahead of deadlines so we aren't stressed the night before the deadline or even the day of the deadline.
  * First and foremost fulfill the needs of the organization's target audience.
  * Show up to meetings on time, and arrive early when we are meeting with the client.


3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

  * Do the work assigned to you before the deadline, or make it clear well in advance that you will need help.
  * Communicate effectively and often about what you have done.
  * ALWAYS pull before working, and when you start working inform the group on what you are working on.
  * Push often, with informative commit messages.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

  * Meet at least once a week (if possible).
  * Communicate mainly using iMessage group often (daily-ish).
  * When there is a meeting confirm that you will be in attendance by giving a thumbs up in iMessage.
  * When there is an update or change in the project give a thumbs up in iMessage that you saw the text and are aware of it.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

We will communicate with our client mainly via email, and we will have in-person meetings at various points throughout the project.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

Ashley
- communicating with client and getting content
- contact page & formatting & layout for contact page
- JavaScript for contact page
- making home page responsive
Shea -
- pathway & layout for pathway page
- making logo
- JavaScript for pathway page
- home page
Irena
- Education
- theme
- write tasks
Jiaxuan
- navigation & making the navigation responsive
- about page
- User Testing
- write tasks

- Everyone should be responsible for making their own page responsive. Unless they are having trouble they may ask a teammate for help.
- Teammates are allowed to add extra touches to each other's pages when they see fit. Especially, when nearing a deadline and a teammate is being unresponsive.


7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

* Own up to our mistakes. Do not blame others or create excuses.
* If you need help or are unsure with a task communicate as soon as a problem arises. Do not wait until the last day to bring up a problem.
* Respectfully start a conversation as an entire group with the person who is not contributing equally. Ask why he/she is not contributing equally.
* Tell the person to either step up their game if their reason for not contributing equally is not valid/legitimate.
* If the problem becomes serious the group members who are contributing equally need to meet up together and discuss what kind of work to give the person who isn't contributing equally.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict do we all agree to uphold?

If we disagree, we should do a quick vote of all members. In the event of a tie, discussion is the next step. From there, it is down to members to come to a conclusion.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

If a member has an idea for a possible change or addition to the contract, simply inform all members through iMessage and we can decide at our next in person meeting whether or not this change should be made.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)



## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
