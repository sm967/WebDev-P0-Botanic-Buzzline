    <p>Did you know that 1 in 3 bites of food is made by pollinators? Or that pollinators contribute more than $24 billion dollars to the US economy? Clearly, we need pollinators, so why aren’t we doing something to address their decline? Well, that’s where the Botanic Buzzline comes in.

    <h3>Why are native pollinators so important?</h3>

    <p>First, pollinators comprise a huge array of species; far more than just butterflies and bumblebees. Native pollinators, specifically, are those insects and animals that have existed somewhere without human introduction. As such, many of them have spent thousands of years co-evolving with local plants to be optimally suited for pollinating them. Honeybees, for example, aren’t actually native to upstate New York, and therefore are less effective than certain native species at transferring pollen from one indigenous flower to the next.

    <h3>How should native pollinators be attracted?</h3>
    <p>Well, by planting native plants! We're looking to buy perennials that don't require constant replanting and come back stronger from year to year. These flowers will be selected for a variety of bloom times and nectar sources so as to be suitable for as many pollinators as possible. This will ensure that animals are attracted to the Botanic Gardens during all pollinating seasons, and that even less established pollinators will have the opportunity to reach nectar that they can access.

      <p id ="insects4"><span>Beetles</span>, like the ladybug, are among the most diverse organisms on earth and play a crucial role in pollination due to their sheer number. They were among the first insects to visit flowers, and today they remain essential pollinators for ancient flower species such as magnolias.</p>

      <p id ="insects2">The mighty <span>bee</span> is arguably nature's most well-known pollinator. More than 4,000 species of bees exist in the United States alone, and out of these the vast majority are solitary bees who do not live in social hives. These bees collect pollen as a source of protein, and often do so by grabbing onto flowers and shaking in a process called sonication.</p>
