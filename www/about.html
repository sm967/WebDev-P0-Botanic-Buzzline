    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <!--This text was writen by members of Botanic Buzzline and given to us to use for the website. -->
    <p>Botanic Buzzline is a student organization with 4 eboard members and 8 general members. Our mission is to connect people, plants, and pollinators on Cornell’s campus by planting a 980 square foot flowing pathway from Tower Road into the Botanic Gardens.</p>

    <h3> Our Goal</h3>
    <!--This text was writen by members of Botanic Buzzline and given to us to use for the website. -->
    <p>
    Despite the fact Cornell has a lot of beautiful vegetation, it is fragmented. This means that pollinators cannot travel to all the different areas of our campus. The Botanic Buzzline hopes to solve this problem by creating a 980- square- foot pathway filled with flowers to not only entice people with their beauty and fragrance but also pollinators.
    The Botanic Buzzline team’s tireless effort of reaching out to the Cornell community was met with success and they were able to surpass their Crowdfunding goal of $10,000.00. The team’s main goal, however, is to “connect people, plants, and pollinators.”
