Mission Statement
  Botanic Buzzline is a student organization with 4 eboard members and 8 general members. Our mission is to connect people, plants, and pollinators on Cornell’s campus by planting a 980 square foot flowing pathway from Tower Road into the Botanic Gardens.

Our Goal

Despite the fact Cornell has a lot of beautiful vegetation, it is fragmented. This means that pollinators cannot travel to all the different areas of our campus. The Botanic Buzzline hopes to solve this problem by creating a 980- square- foot pathway filled with flowers to not only entice people with their beauty and fragrance but also pollinators.

The Botanic Buzzline team’s tireless effort of reaching out to the Cornell community was met with success and they were able to surpass their Crowdfunding goal of $10,000.00.
The team’s main goal, however, is to “connect people, plants, and pollinators.”

###Home###
Botanic Buzzline will create a flowering pathway of native Perennials from Tower Road to the Cornell Botanic Gardens to attract native pollinators to the gardens. The hope is to offset the negative effects of Climate Change and pesticides on our environment.


###Updates###
Planting Day will be in the Spring!
The official date is TBA!
On planting day we will be planting perennials on the pathway!

What's the Buzz
Did you know that 1 in 3 bites of food is made by pollinators? Or that pollinators contribute more than $24 billion dollars to the US economy? Clearly, we need pollinators, so why aren’t we doing something to address their decline? Well, that’s where the Botanic Buzzline comes in:

Why are native pollinators so important?

First, pollinators comprise a huge array of species; far more than just butterflies and bumblebees. Native pollinators, specifically, are those insects and animals that have existed somewhere without human introduction. As such, many of them have spent thousands of years co-evolving with local plants to be optimally suited for pollinating them. Honeybees, for example, aren’t actually native to upstate New York, and therefore are less effective than certain native species at transferring pollen from one indigenous flower to the next.

How should native pollinators be attracted?

Well, by planting native plants! We're looking to buy perennials that don't require constant replanting and come back stronger from year to year. These flowers will be selected for a variety of bloom times and nectar sources so as to be suitable for as many pollinators as possible. This will ensure that animals are attracted to the Botanic Gardens during all pollinating seasons, and that even less established pollinators will have the opportunity to reach nectar that they can access.

Learn About Insects!

Beetles, like the ladybug, are among the most diverse organisms on earth and play a crucial role in pollination due to their sheer number. They were among the first insects to visit flowers, and today they remain essential pollinators for ancient flower species such as magnolias.

Being primarily nocturnal, moths take the night shift of pollination duties. Moths love visiting flowers with heavy fragrance and copious volumes of nectar, and serve as valuable pollinators due to the pollen-trapping hairs along their bodies.

The mighty bee is arguably nature's most well-known pollinator. More than 4,000 species of bees exist in the United States alone, and out of these the vast majority are solitary bees who do not live in social hives. These bees collect pollen as a source of protein, and often do so by grabbing onto flowers and shaking in a process called sonication.
Few things exemplify the beauty of nature better than a butterfly stopping at a flower for a meal of nectar. Butterflies can travel as far as 2,000 miles over a season, making them one of the most distance-covering pollinators we know.

###Pathway page ###
During the Fall of 2018, a 980-square-foot pathway was set up from Tower Road to the Botanic Gardens. Soon the pathway will be filled with flowers, which is to occur in the Spring of 2019! This pathway won't just be for humans to enjoy, but also native pollinators.
